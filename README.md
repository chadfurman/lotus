## Introduction to Lotus

Lotus is simply a script runner with menus in a CLGUI (that's command-line graphical user interface...) All functionality beyond the initial load-up is provided by plugins. 

Plugins are simply bash scripts that exist in the $LOTUS_DIR/lib folder and follow a few conventions (see below for more on plugin development)



## Core plugins

The following core plugins come with Lotus:

* target
    * The most important command -- creates files in the $LOTUS_DIR/data/target/ directory (i.e. host, website, domain, etc)
* pingsweep
    * (re-)generates a list of active hosts (using data from target) in $LOTUS_DIR/data/pingsweep/active_hosts
* save_project
    * Create a tarball of the data directory and save it to $LOTUS_DIR/saved_data
* load_project
    * List out saved projects and facilitate extracting them to $LOTUS_DIR/data
* clear_project
    * Delete $LOTUS_DIR/data
* Other
    * There are several other plugins in the $LOTUS_DIR/lib folder -- check them out :)

## Menus
Plugins can either include a menu or simply be nothing but a menu, serving as a way to organize other commands.  

Some of the existing menus come with Lotus are:
* Recon (menu)
    * Tools for the active/passive discovery stage of a pentest
* Attack (menu)
    * Tools for exploitation.  Websites, binaries, social engineering, etc.
* Misc. (menu)
    * Utilities like color code references, hex/binary encoders, etc


## Creating Plugins

#### Basic Plugins
A great example of a basic plugin is the colors.sh plugin

1) All plugins start with the following line: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
2) If a plugin is named "some_plugin.sh" then that plugin has a "some_plugin()" function which serves as its main method
3) To ensure that plugins can either be run from the CLI or from a `source`, include the following
```
if [[ "$0" == "$BASH_SOURCE" ]]; then
	target "$@"
fi
```
4) Define all variables at the start of the file.  Give them default values, but don't override any values from globals.  For example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
DIR=${DIR:-$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )/../" && pwd )}
DATA=${DATA:-"$DIR/data"}
HEADER_HEIGHT=${HEADER_HEIGHT:-0}
BASE_INDENT=${BASE_INDENT:-0}
PROMPT_LINE=${PROMPT_LINE:-20}
TARGET_LINE=${TARGET_LINE:-12}
```
5) Plugins that take in options must have a parse_flags() function which gets called by init and sets environment variables from the CLI args (or any other flag-based action):
```
parse_flags() {
	while [ ! $# -eq 0 ]
	do
		case "$1" in
			--help | -h)
				helpmenu
				exit
				;;
			--data | -d)
				shift
				DATA=$1
				;;
			--saved-data | -s)
				shift
				SAVED_DATA=$1
				;;
			--name | -n)
				shift
				NAME=$1
				;;
		esac
		shift
	done
}
```
6) Plugins must have a helpmenu function that details their purpose and any arguments they take.

#### Menus
A great example of a plugin with a menu is the target.sh plugin.

If the plugin has a menu, there are a additional conventions:

2) The "some_plugin()" method calls "init()" which ensures the output directories exist and all dependencies are met
3) The "some_plugin()" method prints a banner _under_ the main "Lotus" banner by targeting line $((HEADER_HEIGHT+1))
4) To ensure the menu loops after each answer, the "some_plugin()" method ends the following way:
```
	tput cup "$PROMPT_LINE" 0
	read -p 'Enter selection: ' selection
	if handle_target "$selection"; then
		target
		return $?
	fi
	return 1
```
5) There exists a "handle_some_plugin()" function which switches on the menu item and performs an action
    * Ideas for actions performed by scripts include (but are not limited to): 
        * generating data in $LOTUS_DIR/data/some_plugin/<file>
        * parsing data generated by other plugins
        * calling other plugins
        * showing additional menus
6) The "handle_some_plugin()" menu returns 0 to loop and 1 to go up a menu (or exit if called directly)
7) Plugins with menus must be able to take the menu selection as an argument when called directly

#### Dependencies
A great example of a plugin with a dependency is the pingsweep.sh plugin

Plugins can specify dependencies without much fuss:
1) Check for the existance of the dependency in $LOTUS_DIR/lib 
    * If it's not there, prompt the user to download it
    * If the user says yes, wget/curl/copy/extract the plugin to lib
2) Check if the dependency generated the necessary output in $LOTUS_DIR/data/plugin_name/required_output_file
    * If it's not there, prompt the user to run the dependency with a default config
    * Optionally, prompt the user for the dependency's arguments
    * If allowing the user to customize dependency arguments, expose those customizations as flags
    
        
## Example Plugin

The following is code from a version of the `misc_menu.sh` plugin.  Let's take a look and then break it down

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

DIR=${DIR:-"$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )/../" && pwd )"}
HEADER_HEIGHT=${HEADER_HEIGHT:-0}
BASE_INDENT=${BASE_INDENT:-0}
PROMPT_LINE=${PROMPT_LINE:-10}
LIB=${LIB:-"$DIR"}

misc_menu() {
	init "$@"

	if [ "$1" ]; then
		handle_misc_menu "$1"
		return $?
	fi

	tput setaf 69
	tput cup $(($HEADER_HEIGHT+1)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo "Misc. Menu"
	tput cup $(($HEADER_HEIGHT+2)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '---------------'
	tput sgr0
	misc_menu_header_height=$(($HEADER_HEIGHT+2))

	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+1)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '1) Colors'
	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+2)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '2) Encode'
	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+3)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '3) Decode'
	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+4)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '0) Back to main menu'
	tput cup "$PROMPT_LINE" 0
	read -p 'Enter selection: ' selection
	
	if handle_misc_menu "$selection"; then
		misc_menu
		return $?
	fi

	return 1
}

init() {
	parse_flags "$@"
	tput cup $HEADER_HEIGHT 0
	tput ed
}

handle_misc_menu() {
	selection="$1"
	case $selection in
	[0,q]) return 1
		;;
	1) source "$LIB/colors.sh"
		colors
		;;
	2) source "$LIB/encode.sh" 
		encode
		;;
	3) source "$LIB/decode.sh" 
		decode
		;;
	*) echo "Invalid selection" 
		;;
	esac
	return 0
}

parse_flags() {
	while [ ! $# -eq 0 ]
	do
		case "$1" in
			--help | -h)
				helpmenu
				exit
				;;
			--menu | -m)
			    shift
				handle_misc_menu "$1"
				exit
				;;
		esac
		shift
	done
}

helpmenu() {
	echo -e "Misc Menu"
	echo -e "A set of miscellaneous tools that can come in handy when dealing with linuxy stuff."
	echo -e ""
	echo -e "Optional arguments:"
	echo -e "\t--help, -h:\t\t\tThis message"
	echo -e "\t--menu <num>, -m <num>:\t\t\tSelect menu item <num>"
}

if [[ "$0" == "$BASH_SOURCE" ]]; then
	misc_menu "$@"
fi

```

#### init
`#!/usr/bin/env bash` Is the mandatory first line of all plugins

#### vars
Then we have the variable definitions
```
DIR=${DIR:-"$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )/../" && pwd )"}
HEADER_HEIGHT=${HEADER_HEIGHT:-0}
BASE_INDENT=${BASE_INDENT:-0}
PROMPT_LINE=${PROMPT_LINE:-10}
LIB=${LIB:-"$DIR"}
```
These are the global variables we're pulling in from config/globals.sh -- we define them here with defaults so we can run the script from the command-line as well, not just through Lotus

DIR -- the folder where lib and data reside (note this plugin does not create data)
HEADER_HEIGHT -- the height of the LOTUS header.  Defaults to 0 when called from CLI
BASE_INDENT -- how far to indent each line
PROMPT_LINE -- the line number to place the menu selection prompt
LIB -- Path to the plugin folder so we can easily call other plugins

#### misc_menu
Next is the primary function of this plugin, `misc_menu`
```
misc_menu() {
	init "$@"

	tput setaf 69
	tput cup $(($HEADER_HEIGHT+1)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo "Misc. Menu"
	tput cup $(($HEADER_HEIGHT+2)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '---------------'
	tput sgr0
	misc_menu_header_height=$(($HEADER_HEIGHT+2))

	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+1)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '1) Colors'
	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+2)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '2) Encode'
	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+3)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '3) Decode'
	tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+4)) $BASE_INDENT 
	echo '0) Back to main menu'
	tput cup "$PROMPT_LINE" 0
	read -p 'Enter selection: ' selection
	
	if handle_misc_menu "$selection"; then
		misc_menu
		return $?
	fi

	return 1
}
```

We start out by passing all arguments given to this script into the init method with: `init "$@"`

`tput setaf 69` -- Here we're setting the color for text that gets printed out after this line

`tput cup $(($HEADER_HEIGHT+1)) $BASE_INDENT` -- We're placing the cursor one line below the main header and $BASE_INDENT columns in from the left
then we echo out the menu, print a series of dashes, and reset all tput settings with `tput sgr0`

We define a helper variable, `misc_menu_header_height=$(($HEADER_HEIGHT+2))` so we have a convenient offset for the plugin menu and menu header, then we print out the menu with the following block:

```
tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+1)) $BASE_INDENT 
echo '1) Colors'
tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+2)) $BASE_INDENT 
echo '2) Encode'
tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+3)) $BASE_INDENT 
echo '3) Decode'
tput cup $(($misc_menu_header_height+4)) $BASE_INDENT 
echo '0) Back to main menu'
```

For this block of text, we need to read in a selection, so we put the cursor on the prompt line offset with `tput cup "$PROMPT_LINE" 0` and then prompt for and read in the user's selection with `read -p 'Enter selection: ' selection`
	
Given the selection, we pass it to the menu handler, `handle_misc_menu`, which will return 0 to loop/recurse, or 1 to exit
```
	if handle_misc_menu "$selection"; then
		misc_menu
		return $?
	fi

	return 1
```

#### init
In other plugins, init will do directory checking/creation, dependency assertion/downloading/executing, and more.
For our basic plugin, we simply parse out any command-line flags with `parse_flags "$@"` and then clear everything below the header with:

```
	tput cup $HEADER_HEIGHT 0
	tput ed
```

#### handle_misc_menu
`selection="$1"` -- we assume that the function is called with the selection as the first argument.

We then do a case statement `case $selection` which results in:
 1) sourcing plugins and calling their functions
 ```
	1) source "$LIB/colors.sh"
		colors
		;;
 ```
 
 2) exiting
 ```
	[0,q]) return 1
		;;
```

 3) or declaring invalid selection
```
	*) echo "Invalid selection" 
		;;
```

After menu selection, `return 0` triggers the loop to recurse, whereas `return 1` would trigger the menu loop to exit.
 

#### parse_flags
Here, we iterate over the command line arguments stored in `$#` and check each one against a set of expected options.  We iterate over the array using shift to pop off the elements we're done with, leaving $1 as the only interesting argument at each step.

`while [ ! $# -eq 0 ]` -- loop until we don't have any args left
`case "$1" in` -- check the first (i.e. current) argument against these patterns
```
--help | -h) # current argument is either --help or -h?
    helpmenu # trigger the helpmenu function
    exit     # ... exit...
    ;;       # end of this case
--menu | -m) #  current argument is menu?
    shift    # okay, get rid of it, we want what's next
    handle_misc_menu "$1" # what's next is the menu selection, pass it along
    exit     # done
    ;;       # end of this case
esac         # end of whole case statement
shift        # get rid of the current argument, we're done with it
done         # loop
}
```


#### helpmenu
All plugins have a helpmenu.  The first printed line is the plugin name, followed by a short description, and then optional arguments.  
```
helpmenu() {
	echo -e "Misc Menu"
	echo -e "A set of miscellaneous tools that can come in handy when dealing with linuxy stuff."
	echo -e ""
	echo -e "Optional arguments:"
	echo -e "\t--help, -h:\t\t\tThis message"
	echo -e "\t--menu <num>, -m <num>:\t\t\tSelect menu item <num>"
}
```

#### flexible suffix
The bit right at the very end makes it so that the main method of the plugin is called automatically when invoked on the CLI, but must be called manually when sourcing the file.  This is to give plugin devs more control over the loading and calling order of things.

```
if [[ "$0" == "$BASH_SOURCE" ]]; then  # When calle dfrom the CLI, $0 and $BASH_SOURCE are equal
	misc_menu "$@" # Just invoke the main function of the plugin when called from CLI directly
fi
```
